1a. Being an independent and being a swing voter are not disjoint. We see this because the probability of the two of them occurring at the same time is nonzero (i.e. 11%).

b. From the information given, we know that 35% of respondents are independent but not swing.

c. P(I) = .35
P(S) = .23
P(B) = .11
P(I∩B) = .24
P(S∩B) = .12

P(IoS) = P(S∩B) + P(I∩B) + P(B). = .24 + .12 + .11 = 0.47

d. We have to find the complement of P(IoS) to answer this question. 
1-P(IoS) = 1-.47 = 0.53

e. Dependence implies that the events have to happen in some particular order, because the outcome of one event influences another. If events are independent, then P(A) * P(B) = P(AB). This is not the case here, because .35 * .23 = .08, not .11 . Thus, the events are dependent.
